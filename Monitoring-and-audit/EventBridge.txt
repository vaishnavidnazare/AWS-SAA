EventBridge (formerly cloudwatch events)
    - it schedules cronjobs, or reacts to certain events pattern, trigger lmbda functions and similar other things.
    - Its primary role is event ingestion, filtering, routing, and triggering workflows or actions.
    - this is called event bus.
        - dafault event bus
        - partner event bus
        - custom event bus
    - Event buses can be accessed by other AWS accounts using Resource-based-policies
    - You can archive events sent to an event bus.
    - ability to replay archived events
    - eventbridge can analyze the events in your bus and infer the schema.
    - the schema registry allows you to generate code for your application , that will know in advance how data is structured in the event bus.
    - Schema can be versioned.
    - we can manage permissions for a specific event bus using resource-based-polcy.


Cloudwatch Insights and Operational Visibility.
    - insights types:
        - Container insights
            - collect,aggregate, summarize metrics and logs from containers.
            - available for containers on 
                - ECS
                - EKS
                - Kubernetes platforms on EC2
                - fargate (both for ECS and EKS)
        - lambda insights
            - monitoring and troublesjooting solution for serverless applications running on AWS lambda.
            - collects, aggregates, and summarizes system-level metrics including CPU time, memory,disk and network.
            - collects, aggregates and summarizes diagnostic information such as cold starts and lambda worker shutdowns.
            - lambda insights is provided as a lambda layer.
        - contributor insights
            - analyze log data and create time series that display contributor data 
                - see metrics about the top n contributor.
                for eg.- identify the heaviest network users.
        - Applicaton insights
            - provides automated dashboards that show potential problems with monitored applications , to help isolate ongoing issues.
            - powered by SageMaker
            - enhanced visibility into your application health
            - findings and alerts are sent to Amazon EventBridge and SSM OpsCenter.
