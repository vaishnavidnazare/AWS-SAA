CloudWatch
    Metrics
    - provides metrics for every service available in AWS.
    - we can also create custom  metrics 
    - we can create dashboard from merics.
    - we can continuously stream cloudwatch metrics to a destination in real-time and low latency.
    logs
    - perfect place to store application logs.
    - we have log groups and log streams 
    - we can define log expiration policies.
    - logs are encrypted by default
    - can setup KMS-based encryption with your own-keys.
    - logs sources
        - SDK, Cloudwatch logs agent, cloudwatch unified agent.
        - elastic beanstalk: collection of logs from applications.
        - ECS: collection from containers
        - AWS lambds: collection from function logs
        - api gateway
        - cloudtrail
        - route53: log DNS queries.
    - Cloudwatch logs insights: to query the logs in cloudwatch. (not a realtime engine, just query engine)
    - Cloudwatch logs s3 export: send all logs to s3 
    - Cloudwatch logs subscriptions: get a real-time log events from cloudwatch logs for processing and analysis.we can also use subscription filter.
    - we also have cloudwatch logs aggregation to aggregrate the logs.
    - logs can be sent from one account to another account.
    - in livetail we can see the event as soon as it enters cloudwatch.

Cloudwatch agents and cloudwatch logs agents.
    - By default no logs from ec2 instance go to cloudwatch, we need to run a cloudwatch agent on ec2 to push the logs files you want.
    - The cloudwatch agent needs proper IAM role
    - the agent can also be setup on on-premise server too.
    - Cloudwatch logs agent
        - old version of the agent
        - can only send to cloudwatch logs
    - Cloudwatch unified agent
        - collect additional system level metrics such as RAM,processes,etc.
        - Collect logs to send to cloudwatch logs
        - Centralized configuration using SSM parameter store.

Cloudwatch ALarms
    - Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric.
    - Alarm states:
        - OK
        - INSUFFICIENT_DATA
        - ALARM 
    - Targets
        - EC2 instance
        - ec2 auto scaling
        - send notification to SNS.
    - Composite alarms are monitoring the states of multiple other alarms.alarms cn be combiined with AND and OR conditions.
    - composite alarms are helpful to reduce alarm noise.
    - alarms can also be set using status_checks
