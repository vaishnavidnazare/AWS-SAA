Elastic Kuberenets service (EKS)
    - way to launch managed Kuberenets cluster on AWS.
    - Kuberentes is an alternative to ECS , similar goal but different API.
    - EKS supports EC2 if you want to deploy worker nodes and fargate if u want to deploy serverless containers.
    - Kubernetes is cloud agnostic.
    - EKS pods are setup in nodes , and Autoscaling can be used for them.
    - Node types
        - Managed Node Groups
            - creates and manages nodes
            - nodes are part of an ASG managed by EKS
            - Supports On-Demand or spot instances.
        - Self Managed nodes
            - nodes created by us then registered to the EKS cluster and then managed by an ASG.
            - we can use prebuilt amazon EKS optimized AMI 
            - supports On-Demand or spot instances.
        - AWS Fargate
            - no maintenance required ; no nodes managed.
    - we can use addons to attach EBS Volumes to instances.
