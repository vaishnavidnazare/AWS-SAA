ECS (Elastic Container Service.)
    - launching docker Container on AWS means launching ECS tasks on ECS Clusters.
    - With EC2 launch type
        - EC2 instances are launched in the cluster.
        - Each EC2 instance must run the ECS agent to register the instance in the ECS Cluster.
        - AWS takes care of starting and stopping the containers.
    - With ECS Fargate launch type
        - no EC2 instances to manage, its all serverless.
    - ECS IAM roles
        - as each instance has an ECS agent , an EC2 instance profile can be created which allows the agent to perform all of its tasks.
        - ECS task roles can be created to allow each task to access different ECS services.
        - task role is defined in the task definition.
    - Load Balancer Integrations.
        - application Load Balancer can be used and is recommended in most cases,
        - network load balancer is recommended only for high throughput/ high performance use cases.
    - data volumes
        - mount EFS file systems onto ECS tasks.
        - works both for ec2 and fargate launch types.
        - fargate + EFS = serverless
        - persistent multi-az shared storage for your containers.
        - amazon s3 cannot be mounted as a file sysytem to ECS tasks.
    - we need to create the ecs cluster and the launch type instances seperately amd then add them to the cluster.

ECS Service Auto scaling (task level not instance level)
    - it uses aws application auto scaling, and is based on.
        - cpu utilisation
        - memory utilisation
        - ALB request count per target.
    - types of scaling 
        - target tracking - based on target value for a specific cloud-watch metric.
        - step scaling - based on a specified cloud watch alarm.
        - scheduled scaling - scale based on specified date/time.
    - most suitable for fargate launch type.

EC2 launch type - Autoscaling EC2 instances
    - ASG 
    - ECS Cluster capacity provider
        - used to automaticlly provision and scale the infra for ECS tasks.
        - it is also paired with ASG
