VPN Connections and Direct Connect.
    - VPN: Quick setup needed, lower bandwidth requirements, cost-sensitive.Encrypted tunnel over public internet.
    - Direct Connect: High bandwidth, consistent performance needed, large data transfers. Dedicated, private physical connection between your data center and AWS.
    - You can use VPN as a backup to Direct Connect for redundancy.
    - Virtual Private Gateway is the VPC attachment point for both.
    - Customer Gateway represents your on-premises equipment.
    - VPN - minutes or hours to setup
    - Direct Connection - months to setup.

RPO and RTO 
    - RTO (Recovery Time Objective):

        Definition: Maximum acceptable time between service disruption and restoration
        Question it answers: "How long can we be down?"
        Example: RTO = 1 hour means service must be restored within 1 hour of failure
        Impacts: Infrastructure design, automation level, costs

    - RPO (Recovery Point Objective):

        Definition: Maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time
        Question it answers: "How much data can we afford to lose?"
        Example: RPO = 15 minutes means you can lose at most 15 minutes of data
        Impacts: Backup frequency, replication strategy, costs

    - Backup and Restore (Slowest, Cheapest)
    - Pilot Light (Minimal Always-On)
    - Warm Standby (Scaled-Down Version Always Running)
    - Multi-Site / Hot Standby (Fastest, Most Expensive)


Geolocation and geoproximity
    - geolocation - route traffic to the resource specified for that locations
    - geoproximity - route traffic to the nearest resource location.

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
    - Technology that combines multiple physical disks into a single logical unit
    - Provides different combinations of:
        Performance (speed)
        Redundancy (fault tolerance)
        Capacity (usable storage)
    - Different RAID levels offer different trade-offs
        RAID 0 (Striping) - Performance
            How it works:
            Data is striped (split) across multiple disks
            No redundancy or fault tolerance
            All disks work in parallel
        
        RAID 1 (Mirroring) - Redundancy
            How it works:
            Data is mirrored (duplicated) across disks
            Exact copy on each disk
            Provides fault tolerance

        RAID 5 (Striping with Parity) - Balance [NOT recommended by AWS for EBS]
            How it works:
            Data striped across disks
            Parity information distributed across all disks
            Parity allows reconstruction if one disk fails

        RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity) - Extra Redundancy [Also recommended for EBS]
            How it works:
            Like RAID 5 but with double parity
            Can survive loss of any TWO disks
            More parity overhead

        RAID 10 (1+0) - Performance + Redundancy
            How it works:
            Combination of RAID 1 (mirroring) and RAID 0 (striping)
            Mirror pairs are striped
            "Stripe of mirrors"

Server-Side Encryption (SSE) - S3 encrypts data after receiving it
Client-Side Encryption (CSE) - You encrypt data before sending to S3

SSE-S3 = Default, simple, free
SSE-KMS = Audit trail, key control, costs money
SSE-C = You provide keys every time, HTTPS only
Client-Side = Encrypt before upload, most control
DSSE-KMS = Dual-layer for compliance
