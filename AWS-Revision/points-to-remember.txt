- To examine highly connected database , or track modifications in data , neptune database is best , which is graph database service.
- For shared access to file data EFS is best and it also scales automatically.
- Static content store -> Amazaon S3.
- Amazaon Dynamo DB with On-Demand capacity model -> automatically scalable and flexible schema changes.
- large-scale physical data transfers of upto petabytes -> snowball devices is good option.
- Continuous monitoring solution for malicious activity -> GuardDuty
- In case of lake-formation. if we want a fine-grained access control on row and cells level then apply data filters according to that.
- Data in transit between an instance and an encrypted volume is also encrypted.
- NLB doesn’t handle SSL/TLS termination. The NLB simply forwards the TCP traffic to the EC2 instances.
- High performance computing, high-speed, low-Latency - Lustre.
- NetApp SnapMirror for data replication.
- Establish cross-account access for the s3 bucket when required to share data from primary data account.
- Gp3 volumes allow for specification of IOPS independently from storage size, can provide upto 16000 IOPS.
- AWS KMS has external key store utilizing external external key managers.
- AWS Datasync includes built-in verification of data integrity during transfer.
- Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network that caches content closer to users, which might reduce latency but is more suitable for static content delivery rather than dynamic Voice over IP communication.
- SAML 2.0-based federation allows the business to integrate their existing Active Directory, enabling their users to access AWS resources using their current credentials without having to create separate AWS identities.
