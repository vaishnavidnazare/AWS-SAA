Global accelerator
    - unicast ip - one server holds one ip address
    - anycast ip - all the servers will hold the same ip address and the client is routed to the nearest one.
    - global accelerator uses the concept of anycast ip
    - it is similar to cloudfront but request always goes to the origin and is not cached anywhere.
