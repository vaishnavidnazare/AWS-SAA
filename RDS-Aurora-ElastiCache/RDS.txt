RDS (Relational Database Service)
    - Uses SQL as query language
    - Allows you to create databases in the cloud which are managed by AWS 
    - it supports following types of DB's 
        - Postgres
        - MySQL
        - MariaDB
        - Oracle
        - Microsoft SQL Server
        - IBM DB2
        - Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)
    - It provides many features like OS patching , backups , monitoring dashboards, Read replicas, Multi AZ setup, Scaling capability (storage autoscaling).
    - We cannot SSH into RDS instances.
    - Read replicas can be created ASYNC with main DB to improve read performance.
        - They can be within AZ, Cross AZ , or Cross Region.
        - No extra cost for within the region read replicas
    - Multi AZ
        - SYNC replication to standby instance
        - Automatic app failover to standby if master fails
    - (connect to db using sqlelectron)

RDS Custom
    - For Oracle and Microsoft SQL server database
    - Access to OS and database customization
    - SSH into EC2 instance

Amazon Aurora
    - Proprietary technology from AWS (Not opensource)
    - It provides very high performance
    - Its storage automatically grows in increments
    - Can have upto 15 read replicas and much faster
    - its costs 20% more than RDS 
    - High availability
    - stores 6 copies of your data across 3 AZ
    - Self healing 
    - Cross region replication also supported
    - Autoscaling for read replicas is available and can be managed by Reader Endpoint.
    - It also provide Backtracks - to restore data at any period of time without using backups
    - Advance concepts include Global database , also integration with ML.
    - Babelfish is used to make commumnication happen between T-SQL and Aurora Postgres-SQL
    - Automated backups in aurora cannot be disabled as they can be in RDS.
    - Has a feature of Database cloning

RDS and Aurora Security
    - Using AWS KMS, TLS certificates, IAM Authentication, Security groups.
    - RDS and Aurora do not have SSH access , only RDS custom supports it.
    - Audit Logs can be enabled and sent to cloudwatch.

RDS Proxy
    - Improve database efficiency by reducing stress on database resources and minimize open connections.
    - Serverless, autoscaling, high-availability.
    - Never publicaly accessible
    
Elasticcache
    - Managed Redis or Memcached
    - In-memory databases with really high performance and low latency.
    - Help reduce load of databases for read intensive workloads.
    - Involves heavy application code changes.
    - Redis can be used not only as a cache but also as a database, message broker, and for complex data operations.
    - Memcached focuses  mainly on pure caching for fast read/write speed.
