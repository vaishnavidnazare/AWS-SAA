Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS.
    - Managed Service
        - Automatically handles capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, application helath monitoring, instance configuration ,...
        - Just the application code is the responsisbility of the developer
        - we still have full control over the configuration
        - beanstalk is a free service on its own we pay just for the underlying instances.
        - create application -> upload version -> launch environment -> manage environment.
        - we can have a web server tier with load balancer and a worker tier with the SQS service from which the instances pull the request.
