Athena
    - Serverless query service to analyze data stored in Amazon S3
    - Uses standard sql language to query the files(Build on presto)
    - Supports CSV,JSON,ORC,Avro,and parquet file types.
    - Pricing: $5.00 per TB of data scanned.
    - Commonly used with amazon Quicksight for reporting/dashboards.
    - use columnar data for cost-savings (less scan) - Apache parquet or ORC is recommended
    - Compress data for smaller retrievals
    - partition datasets in S3 for easy querying on virtual columns.
    - use larger files to minimize overhead (> 128 MB)
    - Federated query
        - Allows you to run sql queries across data stored in Relational, non-Relational, object, and custom data sources
        - Uses data source connectors that run on AWS Lambda to run federated queries.
        - store the results back in S3


Redshift
    - based on postgreSQL m but its not used for OLTP
    - used for OLAP - online analytical processing.
    - 10x better performance than other data warehouses, scales to PBs of data.
    - columnar storage of data instead of row based, and parallel query engine
    - two modes: provisioned cluster or serverless cluster
    - has sql interface, for queries.
    - BI tools such as amazon Quicksight or tableau integrate with it.
    - VS Athena: faster queries/joins/ aggregations thanks to indexes.
    - has the concept of leader and compute Node 
        - leader node: for query planning; results aggregations
        - compute node: for performing queries; send results to leader.
        - provisioned mode: choose instance types in advance; can reserve instances for cost savings.
    - Redshift has multi AZ mode for some clusters
    - Snapshots are point in time backups of a cluster stored internally in S3
    - snapshots are incremental.
    - you can restore a snapshot into a new cluster
    - Automated: every 8hours, every 5 GB, or on a schedule . set retention.
    - Manual: snapshot is retianed until you delete it.
    - You can configure redshift to automatically copy snapshots(automated or Manual) of a cluster to another AWS Region.
    - data is loaded in redshift using
        - amazon kinesis data firehose
        - S3 using copy command
        - EC2 instance JDBC driver
    - Redshift spectrum
        - Query data that is already in S3 without loading it.
        - Must have a Redshift cluster available to start the query
        - the query is then submitted to thousands of redshift spectrum nodes.
        - then query result is sent to compute nodes.


Amazon OpenSearch service
    - it is a successor to amazon elasticsearch
    - In dynamodb, queries only exist by primary key or indexes.
    - with OpenSearch , you can search any field, even partially matches.
    - it can be used complement to another database.
    - Two modes: managed cluster or serverless cluster
    - does not natively support sql
    - Ingestion from kinesis data firehose, AWS IOT, and cloudwatch logs.
    - security through cognito and IAM, KMS encryptions, TLS.
    - comes with opensearch dashboards


EMR(Elastic MapReduce)
    - helps creating hadoop clusters(big data) to analyze and process vast amount of data.
    - The clusters can be made of hundreds of EC2 instances
    - it takes care of all provisioning and configuration
    - autoscaling and integrated with spot instances.
    - it comes bundled with apache spark , hbase, presto, flink...
    - master node: manage the cluster , coordinate, manage health - long running
    - core node: run tasks and store data - long running
    - task node(optional): just to run tasks - usually Spot.
    - on-demand: wont be terminated, reliable, predictable
    - reserved: min 1 year;cost savings
    - spot instances: cheaper, can be terminated; less reliable.
    - can have long-running cluster, or transient (temporary) cluster.


Quicksight
    - Serverless machine learning-powered business intelligence service to create interactive dashboards.
    - fast, automatically scalable, embeddable, with per-session Pricing
    - integrated with rds, athena, s3, redshift,..
    - in-memory computation using SPICE engine if data is imported into QuickSight.
    - Enterprise Edition: Possibility to setup column-level security (CLS)
    - can also integrate with third party data sources and databases.
    - can also import data sources directly into QuickSight
    - define users (standard versions) and groups (Enterprise versions)
        - these users and groups only exist within Quicksight and not IAM
    - A dashboard is a read-only snapshot of an analysis(with the configurations you made for the analysis) that you can share.
    - to share a dashboard you must first publish it.


AWS Glue
    - Managed ETL Service (Extract , transform and load)
    - useful to prepare and transform data for analytics.
    - Fully serverless service.
    - also used to convert data into parquet format.
    - it has amazon glue data catalog which uses aws glue data crawler to fetch all data and then store it in catalog from where the data is used for transformation.
    - glue job bookmarks: prevent re-processing old data.
    - Glue databrew: clean nad normalize data using pre built transformation.
    - glue studio: new GUI , run nad monitor ETL jobs in glue.
    - Glue streaming ETL

Lake Formation
    - data lake: central place to have all your data for analytics purposes
    - Fully managed service that makes it easy to setup a datalake in days.
    - discover, cleanse, transform, and ingest data into your data lake.
    - automates many complex manual steps.
    - combine structured and unstructured data in the data lake.
    - out-of-the-box source blueprints: S3, RDS, Relational nad nosql DB.
    - fine-grained access control for your applications (row and column-level)
    - Built on top of AWS Glue.
    - datalake stored in aws s3.

Amazon managed service for apache flink
    - Previously named : kinesis data analytics for apache flink
    - Flink(java,Scala or SQL) is a framework or processing data streams.
    - it allows us to run any apache flink application on a managed cluster on AWS.
    - flink does not read from amazon data firehose.


Amazon managed streaming for apache kafka (MSK)
    - Alternative to amazon kinesis
    - Fully managed apache kafka on AWS
        - Allow you to create update and delete clusters.
        - MSK creates and manages kafka brokers nodes and zookeeper nodes for you
        - deploy the MSK cluster in your VPC, Multi-AZ (up to 3 for HA)
        - automativ recovery from common failures
        - Data is stored on EBS volumes for as long as u want.
    - MSK serverless
    - there are some differences between it and kinsesis.


Big Data ingestion pipeline
    - we want ingestion pipeline to be fully serverless.
    - This can be done using all the different services coming hand in hand.
