EBS
    - EBS Volume is a network drive attached to instances.
    - Allows instances to persist data even after termination
    - EBS volumes are specific to AZs


EBS Snapshots
    - Backup of volumes to reuse or reattach
    - We can use ebs volumes across AZs using Snapshots
    - We can move EBS volume to archive tier which is 75% cheaper but it take 24 to 72 hours to restore that snapshots.
    - Deleting snapshots stores them in recycle bins 
    - We can use fast snapshot restore for no latency but it costs more

AMI(Amazon Machine Image)
    - They are customization of EC2 instances.
    - They are a package of software configuration, operating system, monitoring tools etc.
    - We can also build an AMI from EC2 instances, this will also create EBS snapshots.

EC2 Instance store
    - Use this if we require high performance hardware disk.
    - They are ephemeral which means, it wil be lost if instance terminated.
    

EBS Volumes Types
    - gp2/gp3 (SSD)
        Balances price and performance for wide variety of workloads
        1Gib to 16Tib storage

    - io1/io2 Block express (SSD)
        Highest performance volumes ,low latency and high throughput

    - st1 (HDD)
        Low cost HDD volume designed for Frequently accessed, throughput intensive workloads

    - sc1 (HDD)
        Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads

EBS Multi Attach
    - allows you to attach the same EBS volume to multiple instances in the same AZ.
    - only available with the io1/io2 volumes
    - can attach upto 16 instances at a time

EBS Encryption
    - all teh data inside volume is encrypted
    - all the data flow between instance and volume is encrypted.
    - all snapshots are encrypted
    - all volumes created from snapshots are encrypted
    - it is handled transparently and we dont need to handle it .
If a volume is not encrypted its snapshot will not be encrypted, thus we need to create a copy of the snapshot encrypt it and then create another volume out of it.
We can also create an encrypted volume from the unencrypted snapshot.


EFS
    - Managed Network File System that can be mounted on many EC2 instanes in multi AZ
    - We need to use security groups to control access to EFS 
    - They are only compatible with Linux based file systems
    - They scale automatically
    - There are different performance and throughput modes.
    - It has storage tiers as standard, infrequent access and archive 
    - Lifecycle policy can be used to move files systems between storage tiers
