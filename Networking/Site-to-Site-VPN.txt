Site-to-Site VPN
    - consider we have AWS infra and Corporate data centre as well , so for them to connect to each other , this is used.
    - customer gateway placed on corporate data centre and VPN gateway placed on AWS vpc, this connection id private over internet.(encrypted)
    - Called as Site-to-Site VPN connection.
    - Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
        - VPN concentrator on the AWS side of the VPN connection.
        - VGW is created and attached to the VPC from which you want to craete the site-to-site vpn connection.
        - possibility to customize the ASN (autonomus system number)
    - customer Gateway (CGW)
        - Software application or physical device on customer sie of the VPN connection.
    - if CGW is public its ip can be used directly to connect, but if its private then NATs public IP needs to be used.
        - and for this to work we need to enable route propagation for VGW in route table.
    - If you need to ping your ec2 instances from on-premises, make sure you add the ICMP protocol on the inbound of your security groups.


AWS VPN CloudHub
