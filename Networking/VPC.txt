VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
  - All new AWS accounts have a default VPC.
  - New instances are launched into default VPC if no subnets are specified.
  - Default VPC has internet connectivity and all EC2 instnaces inside it have public IPv4 addresses.
  - We also get a public and private IPv4 DNS names.
  - Can have multiple VPCs in AWS region.
  - Max. CIDR per VPC is 5, for each CIDR:
      - Min. size is /28 (16 IPs)
      - Max. size is /16 (65536 IPs)
  - Your VPC CIDR should NOT overlap with your other networks.

Subnets
  - AWS reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 and last 1) in each subnet.
  - These 5 IP addresses are not available for use and cant be assigned to an EC2 instance.
  - Example: if a CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are:
      - 10.0.0.0 - Network address.
      - 10.0.0.1 - reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
      - 10.0.0.2 - reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS
      - 10.0.0.3 - reserved by AWS for future use.
      - 10.0.0.255 - Network Broadcast Address. AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC , therefore the address is reserved.
  - If you need 29 IP adddress for EC2 instances you cannot choose a subnet of size /27 you need to use /26 due to the resrved IPs.
