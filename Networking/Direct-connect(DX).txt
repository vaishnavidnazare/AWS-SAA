Direct Connect (DX)
    - Provides a dedicated private connection from a remote network to your VPC.
    - Dedicated connection must be setup between your DC and AWS Direct Connect locations.
    - You need to setup a VGW on your VPC.
    - Access public resources(S3) and private (EC2) on same connection.
    - Supports both IPv4 and IPv6
    

Direct Connect Gateway
    - if you want to setup a Direct Connect to one or more VPC in many different regions (same account), you must use a direct connect Gateway.
    

Connection Types
    - Dedicated Connections
    - Hosted Connections

Lead times are often longer than 1 month to establish a new connection.

If we want encryption then we can setup
    - AWS Direct Connect + VPN provides an IPsec-encrypted private connection.
Good for extra level of security but complex.


Direct Connect - Resiliency
    - High Resiliency for critical workloads - (two centres two connections)
    - Maximum Resiliency for critical workloads - (two centres 4 connections , 2 each)


In case Direct Connect fails, you can set up a backup Direct Connect Connection (expensive), or a Site-to-Site VPN connection.
