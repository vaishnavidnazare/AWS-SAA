CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) - IPv4
  - A method for allocating Ip addresses.
  - They help define an IP address range.
  - CIDR consists of two components:
    - Base IP
        - Represents an IP contained in the range (XX.XX.XX.XX)
    - Subnet Mask
        - Defines how many bits can change in the IP
        - Can take two forms:
            - /8 <-> 255.0.0.0
            - /16 <-> 255.255.0.0
            - /24 <-> 255.255.255.0
            - /32 <-> 255.255.255.255
    - The Subnet Mask basically allows part of the underlying IP to get additional next values from the base IP
        - /32 allows for 1 IP (2^0)
        - /31 allows for 2 IP (2^1) and so on...
    - This means:
        - /32 - no octet can change
        - /24 - last octet can change
        - /16 - last 2 octets can change
        - /8 - last 3 octets can change
        - /0 - all octets can change

Public vs Private IP (IPv4)
  - The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) established certain blocks of IPv4 addrresses for the use of private (LAN) and public (Internet) addresses.
  - Private IP can only allow certain values:
      - 10.0.0.0/8 - in big networks
      - 172.16.0.0/12 - AWS default VPC in that range.
      - 192.168.0.0/16 - eg.: home networks.
  - All the rest of the IP addresses on the Internet are Public.
