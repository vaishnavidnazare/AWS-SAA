Internet Gateway (IGW)
    - Allow resources in a VPC to connect to the internet.
    - it scales horizontally and is highly available and redundant.
    - must be created seperately from a vpc.
    - one vpc can only be attached to one gw and vice versa
    - Internet gw on their own do not allow internet access.., route tables must be edited.
