NACL (Network Access Control List)
    - security groups are instance level.
    - NACL are subnet level.
    - NACL are stateless. (seperate inbound and outbound rules)
    - security groups are stateful. (whatever accepted in is also allowed to go out)
    - NACL are like a firewall which control traffic from and to subnets.
    - One NACL per subnet, new subnets are assigned teh Default NACL.
    - You Define NACL rules:
        - rules have a number (1-32766), higher precedence with a lower number.
        - First rule match will drive the decision.
        - the last rule is an asterisk (*) and denies a request in case of no rule mastch.
    - Newly created NACLs will dent everything.
    - NACL are a great way of blocking a specific IP address at the subnet level.
    - Default NACL accepts everything inbound/outbound with the subnets its associated with.
    - Do not modify default NACL , instead create custom NACLs.
    

Ephemeral Ports
    - For any two endpoints to establish a connection, they must use ports.
    - clients connect to a defined port, and expect a response on an ephemeral port.(it is the port that is used by the client temporarily until the connection is open)
    - different OS use different port ranges.
