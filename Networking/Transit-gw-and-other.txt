Transit Gateway
    - For having Transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on-premises, hub-and-spoke (star) connection.
    - VPCs are not peered to each other ut are connected through TGW.
    - regional resource can work cross region.
    - share cross-account using Resource Access Manager (RAM)
    - You can peer transit gateways across regions.
    - Route tables : limits which vpc can talk with other VPC.
    - Works with Direct Connect Gateway, VPN connections.
    - Aupports IP Multicast (not supported by any other AWS service)

ECMP (Equal-cost multi-path routing)
    - Routing strategy to allow to forward a packet over multiple best path.
    - Use case: create multiple Site-to-Site VPN connections to increase teh bandwidth of your connection sto AWS.


VPC- Traffic mirroring
    - Allows you to capture and inspect network traffic in your VPC
    - Route the traffic to security appliances that you manage.
    - capture the traffic   
        - from (source) - ENIs
        - to (targets) - An ENI or a NLB
    - capture all packets or cature the packets of your interest.
    - source and target can be in the same VPC or different VPCs.


IPv6
    - IPv4 is designed to provide 4.3 billion addressses (they'll be exhausted soon)
    - IPv6 is the successor of IPv4
    - IPv6 is desgned to provide 3.4 * 10^38 unique IP addresses.
    - every IPv6 address in AWS is public and internet-routable (no private range)
    - hexadecimal.
    - IPv4 cannot be disabled for your VPC or subnets.
    - You can enable IPv6 to operate in dual stack mode.
    - Your ec2 instances will get at least a private internal IPv4 and a Public IPv6.
    - they can connect from either , to the internet through an internet gateway.


Egress only Internet Gateway
    - used for IPv6 only.
    - Similar to NAT gw but for IPv6
    - Allows instances in your VPC outbound connections over IPv6 while preventing the internet to initiate an IPv6 connection to your instances.
    - updating route tables is required.


AWS Network Firewall
    - Protect entire VPC.
    - layer 3 to layer 7 protection.
    - Internally the firewall uses AWS Gateway Load Balancer.
    - rules can be centrally managed cross-ccount by AWS Firewall Manager to apply to many VPCs.
    - supports 1000s of rules.
    - filter by ip or protocol, or domain level , pattern matching regex etc.
