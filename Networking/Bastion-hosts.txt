Bastion Hosts
    - Private EC2 instances cannot be accessed directly from the internet.
    - We can use bastion host to ssh into our private EC2 instances.
    - The bastion is in the public subnet which is then connected to all othe private subnets using security groups.
    - Bastion host security group must allow inbound traffic from the internet on port 22 from restricted CIDR (only org)
    - Security groups of the EC2 instances in the private subnet must allow the security group of the bastion host, or the private ip of the bastion host.
