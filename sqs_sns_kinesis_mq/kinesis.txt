    - Collect and store sreaming data in real time.
    - Retention between upto 365 days.
    - ability to reprocess data by consumers
    - data cant be deleted from kinesis until it gets expired.
    - data upto 1MB
    - encryption at rest with KMS , and encryption in-flight with HTTPS.
    - to write an optimized producer application use KPL (kinesis producer library)
    - to write an optimized consumer application use KCL (kinesis client library)
    - Capacity modes
        - provisioned mode
            - choose number of shards
            - each shard get 1 MBps in (or 1000 records per sec)
            - each shard gets 2 MBps out 
            - pay per shard provisioned per hour
        - On-demand mode
            - no need to provision or manage the capacity.
            - default - 4MBps in or 4000 records per sec.
    - producers can be kinesis agent, aws SDK , KPL.
    - consumers can be kinesis data analytics, kinesis data firehose, KCL.
    

Kinesis Data firehose (amazon data firehose)
    - is a service to send data from different sources to a target.
    - the data received by firehose can be transformed using lambda functions.
    - the data is sent further in batches, to the destinations.
    - the data can also be backed up to s3 bucket.
    - it is a fully managed service.
    - Automatic scaling, serverless, pay for what you use.
    - Near-real time with buffering capability based on size/time.
