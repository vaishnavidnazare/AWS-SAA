snowball
    - highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge and migrate data into and out of AWS.
    - helps migrate upto petabytes of data 
    - snowball edge storage optimized, snowball edge compute optimized
    - Snowball cannot import to Glacier directly, we need to use amazon S3 with lifecycle policy.

Amazon FSx
    - Amazon FSx Overview
        Fully managed third-party file system solutions on AWS: Windows File Server, Lustre, NetApp ONTAP, and OpenZFS.

        Handles setup, patching, maintenance, scalability, hardware, and software administration.

        Integrated with AWS cloud-native services.

        - 1. FSx for Windows File Server

                Native, managed Windows file system supporting SMB, NTFS file systems, and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) integration.

                Designed for Windows-based workloads requiring file sharing, ACLs, NTFS, shadow copies, quotas, and DFS Namespaces.

                Works with EC2, WorkSpaces, AppStream, VMWare Cloud on AWS, and on-premises via Direct Connect/VPN.

                SSD-backed; up to 2 GB/s throughput, hundreds of thousands of IOPS, consistent sub-millisecond latency.

                Can set user quotas and use data deduplication for cost reduction.

                Access via "Map Network Drive" or Windows Shared Folders UI.

                High availability:

                All file systems automatically replicate within the same AZ.

                Multi-AZ deployment adds cross-AZ replication with active-standby setup; ensures data availability during AZ failure.

                DFS Namespaces allow grouping shares into a single logical folder structure, scalable to hundreds of PBs and tens of GBs per second.

                Uses VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) for daily backups to S3, restores possible for individual files.

                Compliant with ISO, PCI-DSS, SOC, HIPAA; encryption in-transit (Kerberos/session keys) and at rest (AWS KMS).

                Charged hourly: storage (per GB), throughput (per MB/s), and backup storage (per GB).

        2. FSx for Lustre

                High-performance, parallel file system for fast processing (HPC, ML, analytics, media workflows).

                POSIX-compliant, works natively with Linux AMIs (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, SUSE).

                Direct integration with S3:

                S3 objects appear as files on Lustre

                Write processed data/results back to S3.

                Data accessible from EC2, on-premises (Direct Connect/VPN), supports bursting workloads to AWS.

                Two deployment types:

                Scratch: short-term, performance-focused, no HA or replication, auto-heal.

                Persistent: long-term, provides HA in one AZ, self-healing.

                Baseline throughput: 200 MBps per TB of provisioned storage; scales up with file system size.

                Millisecond/sub-millisecond latencies; millions of IOPS; hundreds of GB/s throughput.

                Files imported/exported to/from S3 and across regions.

                Supports security groups, encryption, IAM.

                Billed per storage and throughput provisioned.

        3. FSx for NetApp ONTAP

                Shared file storage for Linux, Windows, macOS via NFS, SMB, iSCSI.

                Supports Storage Virtual Machines (SVMs), volumes, CLI/REST API management, replication (SnapMirror), caching (FlexCache).

                Automatic capacity tiering: cold/infrequently accessed data is transitioned to a lower-cost capacity pool.

                Multi-protocol access; suitable for lift-and-shift NAS workloads.

                Policy-driven data management, snapshots, cross-region backup copies.

        4. FSx for OpenZFS

                Managed OpenZFS file system; Linux, Windows, macOS via NFS.

                Data management: compression, point-in-time snapshots, cloning, thin provisioning, user/group quotas.

                Backups to S3, multi-volume support, cross-region copy.

                Powered by AWS Graviton processors for performance and efficiency.

                General Security & Compliance
                Encryption at-rest (AWS KMS) and in-transit (protocol level).

                Integration with CloudTrail for API monitoring/logging.

                Access control via IAM and AD (for Windows).

                Compliant with main security/regulatory standards.

                Cost Optimization
                Data deduplication, automatic tiering, pay-as-you-go pricing model, user quotas help control and optimize storage costs.
