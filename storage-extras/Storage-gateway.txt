Storage gateway
    - Cloud native options
        - block storage
            - EBS
            - EC2 Instance store 
        - File storage
            - EFS
            - FSx
        - Object storage
            - S3 
            - Glacier

    - Storage gateway is a bridge between on premise data and cloud data.
    - Types of storage gateway
        - S3 File gateway
            - Cannot use s3 glacier storage class type bucket
            - can transfer to s3 glacier using life cycle policy
            - Allows to use NFS(Network File System) and SMB(Server Message Block) protocol and trnansfers request as HTTPS to the bucket.
            - most recently used data is cached in the file gateway.

        - Volume gateway
            - Block storage using iSCSI(Internet Small Computer System Interface) protocol backed with S3
            - Backed by EBS snapshots
            - types:
                - cached volumes- low latency access to most recent data 
                - stored volumes- entire dataset is on premise , scheduled backups to s3
        - Tape gateway
            - Virtual tape library backed by amazon s3 and glacier
            - Tape Gateway presents an iSCSI-based virtual tape library (VTL) to existing on-premises backup applications, allowing organizations to move away from managing physical tape infrastructure.
            - Data written to virtual tapes is initially cached locally for low-latency access, then asynchronously uploaded and stored in AWS cloud storage services such as Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, or S3 Glacier Deep Archive for long-term retention.
