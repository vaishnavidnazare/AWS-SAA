Dynamo DB
    - Fully managed highly available with replication across multiple AZs.
    - not a relational database with transactional support.
    - can be sacled massively.
    - Fast and consistent 
    - has all security aspects - IAM, authorization and administration.
    - low cost and autoscaling capability.
    - no need to provision, always available.
    - it is made of tables, in which we create a primary key at the time of table creation.
    - can have infinite number of items (=rows)
    - each item has attributes (can be added over time or can be null)
    - maximum size of an item is 400KB
    - data types supported are 
            - scalar types
            - document types
            - set types
    -there are capacity modes to manage the table capacity
        - provisioned mode
            -  need to plan the capacity beforehand by specifying the number or reads/writes per sec.
            - pay for provisioned read capacity units and write capacity units.
            - autoscaling mode can be added to scale RCU and WCU
        - on-demand mode
            - no capacity planning required , it scales automatically
            - pay for what you use
            - more expensive


Dynamo DB Accelerator (DAX)
    - fully managed , highly available , seamless in-memory cache for dynamo DB.
    - help solve read congestion by caching
    - microseconds latency for cached data
    - doesnt require application logic modification , works with dynamo Db existing APIs.
    - application -> DAX Cluster -> DynamoDB
    - there is also stream processing 
        - ordered stream of item level modification - which helps to take actions on the item modifications done.
        - we have dynamo db streams and kinesis data streams each with different propeties of retention etc. (kinesis has higher retention and consumers)


There are dynamo db global tables, which have replicas in different region , the prerequisite for it is dynamo db data streams.

    - there is TTL set in dynamo db which is by default minutes after which items get deleted.It can be used for session handling etc.
    - dynamo db can be used for disaster recovery.
        - continuous backups using point-in-time recovery(PITR)
        - on-demand-backups

Dynamo DB integration with amazon s3
    - we can export dynamo to s3 (need to enable PITR).
    - we can also import files from s3 to dynamo DB in table format.
