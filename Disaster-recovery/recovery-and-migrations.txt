Disaster Recovery
    - RPO = Recovery Point Objective -> How frequent backups are taken, means how much of data loss can u accept/are ready to accept if diaster happens.
    - RTO = Recovery Time Objective -> Recover from disaster, time after disaster until the recovery.
    - Disaster recovery strategies
        - Backup and restore (high RPO,RTO)
        - pilot light (lower RPO,RTO)
            - smaller version of app is always running in the cloud
            - use for critical core 
        - warm standby (lower RTO,RPO)
            - full system is up and running, but at minimum size.
            - upon disaster we can scale upto production load.
        - Hot site/ Multi site approach (very low RTO, very expensive)
            - full production scale is running aws and on premise.


Database Migration Service (DMS)
    - quick and securely migrate databases to AWS, resilient, self healing.
    - the source database remains available during the migartion.
    - Continuous data replication using CDC 
    - you must create an ec2 instance to perform the replication tasks.
    - when Multi-AZ enabled , DMS provisions and maintains a synchronously stand replica in a different AZ.

AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)
    - Convert your databases schema from one engine to another.

RDS and Aurora MYsql migrations
RDS and Aurora postgresql migrations

Application Migration Service (MGN)
    - Application discovery service
        - Agentless
        - Agent-based
    - Lift and shift.

Snowball used for large datasets migrations.


VMWare Cloud on AWS
    - used to manage on-premise data centres.
    - want to extend the data centre capacity to AWS, but keep using the VMWare cloud software.
