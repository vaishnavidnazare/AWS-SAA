S3 lifecycle rules
    - this rules are user defined which choose or switch the storage classes between the available ones.
    - It is not like intelligent tier where there was no human intervention and the different frequent and infrequent classes were defined.
    - we can use amazon S3 analytics to transition objects to the right storage classes , this are used only for standard and standard IA.

S3 Requester Pays
    - With requester pays buckets, the requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request and the data download from the bucket.
    - helpful when you want to share large datasets with other accounts.
    - the requester must be authenticated in AWS.

S3 Event Notifications
    - Event can be of or due to object creation, object removed, object restored, object replication, etc..

    - from S3 bucket all events go to amazon event bridge and then reach different destinations by the rules defined in the jsons.
